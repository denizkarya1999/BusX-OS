# Welcome to BusX OS User Interface Repository

In this repository, I would like to introduce my user interface designs for an open source operating system project which I am planning to develop. Unfortunately, developing an operating system requires a lot of people and funding however with cooperation on GitHub and a little bit of funding could make this project real. The reason why I plan to develop an operating system is I would like to provide people an opportunity to experience open source software and Linux. I would also like to make Linux more user friendly. I am not doing this for profit I just like to experience of cooperating with developers from different fields and money donated to this project will go directly to non-profit organizations.
